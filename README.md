## Introduction
Customer churn analysis is the process of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their subscription or stop doing business with a company. By analyzing patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, businesses can implement strategies to retain their customers and reduce churn rates.

This project aims to analyze customer churn data, build predictive models, and provide insights to help improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on customers, their subscription details, usage patterns, and whether they have churned or not. The dataset should be placed in the `data/raw/` directory.

### Example Data Columns:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Product Type
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Churn (Yes/No)

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd customer-churn-analysis
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset and understand the features and target variable using the `01_data_exploration.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming features using the `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook.
3. **Modeling:** Build predictive models to identify churned customers using the `03_modeling.ipynb` notebook.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using various metrics in the `04_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

## Analysis and Results
- Detailed analysis of the dataset, including descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Predictive models built using various algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.).
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
